====================
Force Invoice Number
====================

This module allows to force the Invoice Number. Invoice number can contain both numbers and letters. The main logic behind the module is to display the "move_name" field. Invoice number would be replaced only if user fills the field, otherwise Odoo will generate the Invoice NUmber.

Usage
=====

After the module is installed a new field "Force Number" will be displayed while creating an invoice. Use it if you want to have a specific Invoice Number.
